 FUNC_1( "D-LINK DWL-2000AP+ with firmware version 2.11 is prone to two remote denial\nof service vulnerability because it fails to handle arp flooding. \nThe first vuln causes the wireless link (802.11) to be resetted and the arp \ntable to be rebuilded. All clients connected to the AP are disconnected.\nThis bug can be triggered by sending lots of arp replies through the wired link\nor the radio one at a very high speed.\nThe second vulnerability affects the wireless link only and are quite harder\nto trigger but causes the AP firmware to crash making a manual reboot mandatory.\nThis bug can be triggered only if no other D-LINK ethernet products are visible \nto AP, if wep encryption is enabled and it needs a very large amount of\narp-requests to be broadcasted through its wireless link at a very high speed. \nThis exploit works in the 90%% of cases because sometimes the AP is able to ban\nthe flooding client before the exploiting process is complete.\nD-LINK doesn't support this product anymore so no solution is available.\nOther products can be vulnerable.\n\nNot vulnerable: DWL-700AP\n\n");
