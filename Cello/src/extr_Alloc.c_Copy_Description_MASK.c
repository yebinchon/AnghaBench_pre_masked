    "The `Copy` class can be used to override the behaviour of an object when "
    "a copy is made of it. By default the `Copy` class allocates a new empty "
    "object of the same type and uses the `Assign` class to set the "
    "contents. The copy is then registered with the Garbage Collector as if it "
    "had been constructed with `new`. This means when using manual memory "
    "management a copy must be deleted manually."

    "By convention `copy` follows the semantics of `Assign`, which typically "
    "means a _deep copy_ should be made, and that an object will create a "
    "copy of all of the sub-objects it references or contains - although this "
    "could vary depending on the type's overridden behaviours.";
